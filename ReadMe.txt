Java-SE-School-Mangement-Project


This is a Java Standard Edition School Management Programm.

The user has two choices.

The first one to loads Synthetic data from a txt file, because there is no database connection.

The second is to press two and then the user insert his own courses, assignments, students, and trainers.


It is a very good project for a Java student to get familiar with Java Object Oriented Programmming.
